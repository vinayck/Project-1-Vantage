	  <h4>For Corporates:</h4>
        <p><ol>
			<li><u>BRAD: Benefit & Risk Analysis and Design – for insured and  self-insured benefits:</u>		
				<ul>
					<li>Developing overall benefit strategy for an organization

						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Harmonization of global & Indian benefit programs
						<ul>
							<li>Inorganic growth is another way to grow and we often see many such mergers and acquisitions on a regular basis. Along with the various other standardisations, harmonisation of the benefits becomes a challenge especially when we have Indian companies making their presence in other geographies or vice versa. This program helps clients align their global benefits to Indian benefits programs.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Benefit harmonization & rationalization
						<ul>
							<li>Benefits harmonisation and rationalisation becomes a challenge when we have large organisations with multiple subsidiaries within the country. The group’s philosophy has to be uniform and hence an uniform benefits strategy/ program to harmonise and rationalise all benefits. </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Benchmarking, plan design, claim analysis & cost projection, plan administration for self-insured health benefit plans
						<ul>
							<li>This program caters to clients who have self-insured benefit plans. From designing to administration is a detailed process which requires market expertise and that’s what Vantage offers.</li>

			</li>
			<li><u>SBI: Strategic Benefit Initiatives </u>
				<ul>
					<li>Design and implementation of flexible benefits
						<ul>
							<li>Flexible benefits is the new buzz word in the industry. Having a flexible benefits model is now imperative keeping in mind the diverse employee group that large service companies cater to. Composition of workforce is skewed towards the under 35 – while policies in the benefits space are geared towards the middle and older age band. Vantage consults in designing and implementing these flexi benefit programs. </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Review of current benefit programs and evaluation of the performance of all service providers
						<ul>
							<li>Where do we stand? What is the benefit of providing the benefits that we are offering? What do our employees feel about it? Are our service providers giving us the best in the market? All these questions are important and hence it’s imperative to review your current offering along with the performance of the all the service providers. A quick check on the effectiveness and value of the benefits program. </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Market trends, legislation, and industry developments report 
						<ul>
							<li>Organisations may have their own philosophy and culture and based on that - their benefits design. However the talent pool that we work with and the environment that we operate in is shared with many other organisations. In order to be competitive and compliant we need to know what the latest market trend is or what the recent legislative directives are. Vantage provides standard and customised solutions to clients, which acts as enablers to get that edge over the rest. </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Develop, design, and implement multinational pooling program
						<ul>
							<li>Large organisations in India, who have made their presence in other countries as well, need a differential benefits program. This offering helps such clients understand the legislative differences across countries and the diverse employee base that they are working with and hence the need of a differential benefits program.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><u>HRM: Health Risk Management & Wellness Services</u>
				<ul>
					<li>Health Risk Assessment of an organization

					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
